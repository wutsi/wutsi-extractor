<p>Today&#8217;s Spotlight is on an up and coming Designer called <strong>Nkafu Sulet</strong> who&#8217;s work as seen in these photos are clearly beautiful! She is the Founder of <strong>Afrik Fashion Trend (AFT)</strong>. Over the last year or two the Cameroonian Fashion industry has experienced rapid growth and as the competition rises, designers are left with no choice but to get more competitive by improving on their art. Cameroonian Designers are definitely giving fashionistas (and fashionmista&#8217;s) a run for their money which is a good thing as people now have choices and dont have to feel the need to turn to our Nigerian or other African couterparts to get the job done!</p>
